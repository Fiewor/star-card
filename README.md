## Overview
During the pandemic the immense contribution and importance of our everyday heroes was undoubtedly spotlighted.
The most important form of reward and help that can be offered to these unsung heroes is the provision of a safe and healthy environment for them to carry out their amazing duties.
This can be fostered through collaboration thereby enhancing workplace safety and productivity for our everyday heros.

One way of doing this is by giving the heroes a platform to report their workplace risks and hazards. Such a  solution can easily be accessed through the effectively display of the hazard and risks in a descriptive and visual manner making it easier for the authorities responsible within the workplace and in the larger society to quickly take necessary actions to mitigate such hazards.


## The problem
According to the [International Labour Organisation](https://www.ilo.org/moscow/areas-of-work/occupational-safety-and-health/WCMS_249278/lang--en/index.htm),
> some 2.3 million women and men around the world succumb to work-related accidents or diseases every year; this corresponds to over 6000 deaths every single day. Worldwide, there are around 340 million occupational accidents and 160 million victims of work-related illnesses annually.

Currently, in some companies in Africa, hazards are usually reported physically using 'safety cards'. This current approach has a few limitations/deterrents which can discourage employees from reporting risk such as:
- Pressure to get the job done in a short amount of time leaves, in most scenarios, employees no time to even go through the strenuous physical process of collecting cards, filling them with pen, going back to the office of the supervisor to submit, waiting for the processing and so on.
- Lack of feedback from reported incidents - it has been [noted](https://safetydifferently.com/stop-start-cards/) that these cards are often difficult to sort and are often unattended to.

## Our Solution 
[Research](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/protecting-workers'-health) has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%.

So, we created Star Card to be an easily accessible web platform for real-time reporting and visibility into various workplace risks and hazards.

The [importance](https://www.uniprint.com.au/blogs/news/why-it-s-important-to-report-hazards-in-the-workplace#:~:text=Why%20Is%20Hazard%20Reporting%20Important,creating%20a%20safe%20working%20environment.&text=Most%20importantly%2C%20it%20ensures%20that,quality%20data%20to%20be%20collected) of reporting hazards cannot be over-emphasized so we aim to make the process easier and more efficient.
### Here is how it works:
The workplace hero (supervisor or employee) who is witnessing an hazard
  - opens the web app
  - signs up to create an organisational workspace
  - logs into their workspace account using their newly created account details
  - gets access to the dashboard from where the user can 
    - add report by filling a form to make reports of hazards in form of text, picture and/or video format.
    - add employee access so other employees within the organisation can also submit risk reports
  - the information entered in these reports are then displayed in a visually in the dashboard.
  - p.s: in a future version of the app, the dashboard display will be more visually appealing through the use of pie charts, bar graphs and other visual aids that help present the data better.
- The compiled dashboard information is now accesible for first responders and other authotities involved to evaluate, prioritize hazard reports and mitigate/handle such hazards appropriately.

## Road Map
Currently, the Star Card Web Application does these:
- allow user signup and login
- allow user to create report
- display hazard/risk report on dashboard

In future versions, we hope to add the following functionalities/feeatures: 
- Allow frontline workers to report hazards to response team by uploading images of hazards and livestreaming hazardous events with the help 
- Also utilise augmented reality and computer vision Technologies.
- Safety verification, authentication and approval using Blockchain technologies.
- Relevant safety policy and safety compliance recommendations via Machine Learning, federated learning technologies and natural language processing.
- Possibilities for language translations.
- Map and Samsung API integrations.
- Possibilities for speech-to-text/text-to-speech input/output.
- Possibilities for using the web app to process hazard reports acquired from agents via sms, ussd and phone calls.
